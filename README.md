Hello! I'm Pranav, an aspiring machine learning engineer. ðŸ‘‹
I have a passion for understanding data to build smarter solutions. Currently exploring complex deep neural networks for natural language processing and computer vision projects.

As an independent researcher, I'm focused on innovations in recommender systems using techniques like collaborative filtering. I believe recommenders have tremendous potential to connect people to personalized content and services.

I collaborate with other developers on Kaggle competitions related to early disease prediction from medical imaging data. Working through tough data challenges helps me learn quickly.

Right now I'm looking to connect with others interested in deep recommender systems research and development. I enjoy technical conversations about:

Applications of deep learning in recommender systems
Novel deep network architectures
Reinforcement learning in content recommendation

I'd be happy to discuss projects, share code, or talk more about potential opportunities to innovate together. Feel free to reach me through my website below!
